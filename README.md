**SOC Environment with Integrated Mythic C2 Server**
This repository provides an overview of a Security Operations Center (SOC) architecture that integrates both log management and monitoring tools, alongside a Mythic Command and Control (C2) server for advanced threat simulation. The setup is designed for cybersecurity professionals, including SOC analysts and red teams, to monitor, manage, and simulate real-world attacks in a controlled environment.

**Architecture Overview**

**Components**:

**SOC Analyst Workstation**

Description: The primary interface for SOC analysts to interact with the monitoring tools and incident response systems.

Key Functionality: Connects to Elastic & Kibana over a secure GUI for real-time log analysis and visualization.
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) on VULTR

**Network Configuration:**

Private IP Range: 171.31.0.0/24
Purpose: Provides an isolated and secure network for the SOC environment.

**Elastic & Kibana**

Description: Centralized log aggregation, visualization, and alerting platform.

**Role in Architecture**: Collects logs from various servers, facilitates real-time monitoring, and triggers alerts based on predefined rules.
**Data Flow**: Logs forwarded from managed servers via agents.

**Fleet Server**

Description: A central management server that oversees the deployment and configuration of agents on other servers.

**Key Functionality**: Ensures consistent log forwarding from managed servers to Elastic & Kibana.

**osTicket Server**

Description: An open-source ticketing system integrated with Elastic & Kibana to manage alerts and incidents.

**Role in Architecture**: Converts alerts into actionable tickets, helping SOC analysts track and resolve incidents efficiently.

**Windows Server (RDP Enabled)**

Description: A managed server within the VPC, primarily used for operations requiring RDP.

**Security Considerations**: Logs all activities and forwards them to Elastic via the Fleet server.

**Ubuntu Server (SSH Enabled)**

Description: A managed Linux server accessible via SSH.

**Key Functionality**: Serves various administrative tasks and forwards logs to Elastic through Fleet.

**Mythic C2 Server**

Description: A Command and Control (C2) server used by penetration testers or red teams to simulate real-world attack scenarios.

**Key Functionality**: Enables the execution of advanced attacks, allowing the SOC team to test and improve their detection and response strategies.

Attacker’s Workstation (Kali Linux)

Description: The attacker's machine used to control the Mythic C2 server, typically for simulating adversarial behavior.

**Role in Architecture**: Provides an external threat perspective, interacting with the VPC environment to validate SOC defenses.

**Logical Flow**

**Log Collection**: The Fleet server manages agents on the Windows and Ubuntu servers, collecting logs and forwarding them to Elastic & Kibana for analysis.

**Incident Management**: Kibana visualizes the data, and alerts are sent to the osTicket server, where they are tracked as incidents.

**Threat Simulation**: The Mythic C2 server, controlled by an attacker using Kali Linux, simulates attacks within the environment, challenging the SOC’s detection and response mechanisms.

**Key Features**
**Centralized Monitoring**: Elastic & Kibana provide a unified platform for log aggregation, visualization, and real-time alerting.

**Incident Tracking**: Integration with osTicket ensures that all incidents are documented and managed from detection to resolution.

**Threat Simulation**: The inclusion of the Mythic C2 server allows for sophisticated threat scenarios to be tested against the SOC setup.

**Conclusion**

This architecture combines robust monitoring and incident management capabilities with advanced threat simulation, creating a comprehensive SOC environment. It is designed to enhance the detection, response, and overall security posture of any organization by ensuring that the SOC is not only reactive but also proactive in dealing with threats.
